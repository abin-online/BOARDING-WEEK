# Bubble Sort Algorithm

## 🛠 Introduction
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the list is sorted.

## 🛠 How Bubble Sort Works
1. Start from the first element and compare it with the next one.
2. If the next element is smaller, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair and repeat step 2.
4. After one full pass, the largest element bubbles up to the last position.
5. Repeat the process for the remaining elements, ignoring the last sorted elements in each pass.
6. The process continues until the array is sorted.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
✅ Simple to implement  
✅ Not efficient for large arrays (O(n²))  
✅ Best for small or nearly sorted data  
✅ Optimized version reduces unnecessary passes  

## 📝 Example Implementation in JavaScript
```javascript
function bubbleSort(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        let swapped = false;
        for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]]; // Swap
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        if (!swapped) break; // Stop if no swaps
    }
    return arr;
}

console.log(bubbleSort([3, 1, 4, -2])); // Output: [-2, 1, 3, 4]
```

## 🚀 Optimized Version
The optimized version of Bubble Sort stops early if no swaps happen in a pass, making it more efficient for nearly sorted data.

## 📚 Time Complexity
- **Worst Case (Reversed Order):** O(n²)
- **Best Case (Already Sorted + Optimization):** O(n)

## 📌 When to Use Bubble Sort?
- When the dataset is small.
- When the dataset is already nearly sorted.
- When learning sorting algorithms, as it provides a good conceptual understanding.

Bubble Sort is a great learning tool but is not used in real-world applications due to its inefficiency. Faster algorithms like **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort** are preferred.
